## SHL - Shift Logical Left

- Can be explicitly used with the C "<<" operator
- First operand (source and destination) is an r/mX
- Second operand is either cl (lowest byte of rcx), or a 1 byte immediate. The 2nd operand is the number of places to shift
- It **multiplies** the register by 2 for each place the value is shifted. More efficient than a multiply instruction
- Bit shifted off the left hand side are "shifted into" (set) the carry flag (CF)
- For purposes of determining if the CF is set at the end, think of it as *n* independent 1 bit shifts

### SHL Example 1 (33 << 2)

`SHL BL, 2` 

||Value|
|-------------|-------------|
||0011 0011b (bl - 0x33)|
|Result|1100 1100b (bl - 0xCC)|

**CF = 0**

### SHL Example 2 (33 << 3)

`SHL, BL 3` 

||Value|
|-------------|-------------|
||0011 0011b (bl - 0x33)|
|Result|1001 1000b (bl - 0x98)|

**CF = 1**
