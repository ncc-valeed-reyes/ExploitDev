## SHR - Shift Logical Right

- Can be explicitly used with the C ">>" operator
- First operand (source and destination) is an r/mX
- Second operand is either cl (lowest byte of rcx), or a 1 byte immediate. The 2nd operand is the number of places to shift
- It **divides** the register by 2 for each place the value is shifted. More efficient than a divide instruction
- Bit shifted off the right hand side are "shifted into" (set) the carry flag (CF)
- For purposes of determining if the CF is set at the end, think of it as *n* independent 1 bit shifts

### SHR Example 1 (33 >> 2)

`SHR BL, 2` 

||Value|
|-------------|-------------|
||0011 0011b (bl - 0x33)|
|Result|0000 1100b (bl - 0x0C)|

**CF = 1**

### SHR Example 2 (33 >> 3)

`SHR, BL 3` 

||Value|
|-------------|-------------|
||0011 0011b (bl - 0x33)|
|Result|0000 0110b (bl - 0x06)|

**CF = 0**
