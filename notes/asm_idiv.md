## IDIV - Signed Divide

- If you were to then change MulDivExample to signed, you would see the IDIV instruction appear
- Three forms
    - Unsigned divide ax by r/m8, al = quotient, ah = remainder
    - Unsigned divide edx:eax by r/m32, eax = quotient, edx = remainder
    - Unsigned divide rdx:rax by r/m64, rax = quotient, rdx = remainder
- If the divisor is 0, a divide by zero exception is raised. :(

### IDIV Example 1

|ax|r/m8 (cx)|
|-------------|-------------|
|0xFE|0x2|

`IDIV AX, CX` 

*In decimal, we see this as: 2 / -2 = -1 with no remainder*

|ah|al|
|-------------|-------------|
|0x0|0xFF|

|Register|Value|
|-------------|-------------|
|RAX|0x000000000000<mark>00FF</mark> -> (Remainder followed by Quotient)|

<hr>

### IDIV Example 2

|rdx|rax|r/mX (rcx)|
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|0x0|0x57e11a|0xb01d|

`IDIV RAX, RCX` 

|rdx|rax|r/mX (rcx)|
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|0x3|0x1|0x5|

|Register|Value|
|-------------|-------------|
|RAX|0x000000000000007F -> (Quotient)|
|RDX|0x00000000000082B7 -> (Remainder)|
