### LEA - Load Effective Address

*Uses the mX form (really just "m" in the manual) but is the exception to the rule that the square brackets [] syntax means dereference!*

*Frequently used with pointer arithmetic sometimes for just arithmetic in general.*

E.g.: rbx = 0x2, rdx = 0x1000

 - `lea rax, [rdx+rbx*8+5]`
 - rax = 0x1015, not the value at 0x1015
