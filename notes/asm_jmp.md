### JMP - Jump

Unconditionally change RIP to given address

Ways to specify the address:
 - Short, relative (RIP = RIP of next instruction + 1 byte sign-extended-to-64-bits displacement)
   - Frequently used in small loops
   - Some disassemblers will indicate this with a mnemonic by writing it as "jmp short"
   - jmp -2 == infinite loop for short relative jmp
   - **"jmp 000000140001012"** doesn't have the number 000000140001012 anywhere in it, it's really **"jmp 0x0c bytes forward"**
   - Far, absolute indirect

JCC - Jump If Condition Is Met
 - If a condition is true, the jump is taken. Otherwise it proceeds to the next instruction
 - There are more than 4 pages of conditional jump types! Luckily a bunch of them are synonyms for each other.
 - JNE == JNZ (Jump if not equl, Jump if not zero, both check if the Zero Flag (ZF) == 0)

 Architecture - RFLAGS
 - RFLAGS register hold many single bit flags. Will only ask you to remember the following for now:
   - Zero Flag (ZF) - Set if the result of some instruction is zero; cleared otherwise.
   - Sign Flag (SF) - Set equal to the most-significant bit of the result, which is the sign bit of a signed integer. (0 indicates a positive value and 1 indicates a negative value)
 - Other flags will be optional material


Example:

- if foo != bar
```assembly
cmp dword ptr [rsp+4], eax
jne 0000000140001033
```

Signed
- if foo <= bar
```assembly
cmp dword ptr [rsp+4], eax
jle 0000000140001043
```

Unsigned
- if foo >= bar
```assembly
cmp dword ptr [rsp+4], eax
jae 0000000140001043
```
