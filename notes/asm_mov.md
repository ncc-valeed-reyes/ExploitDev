### MOVZX - Move With Zero-Extend

*Moves and extends the value with zeroes*

E.g.
```assembly
mov eax, 0xF00DFACE
movzx rbx, eax
```

`rbx`: 0x00000000`F00DFACE

### MOVSXD - Move With Sign-Extension

*Moves the signed dword value and extends with **FF** or **00***

E.g.

```assembly
mov eax, 0xF00DFACE
movsxd rbx, eax
```

`rbx`: 0xFFFFFFFF`F00DFACE
Because the sign bit (MSB) of 0xF00DFACE is 1, it should be treated as negative by adding F's. But if the (MSB) is 0 then replace it with zeroes

### MOVSX - Move With Sign-Extension

*Moves the signed value and extends with **FF** or **00**. Same as movsxd.*
